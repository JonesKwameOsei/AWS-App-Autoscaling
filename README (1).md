# Creating a load-balanced Web Server with Auto Scaling.

This is a structured training on AWS. AWS Auto Scaling monitors applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.


## Overview
This project seeks to expose cloud engineers and soultions architects through the methodology of creating a web server that is well managed by an auto scaling group. With a launch template, the auto scaling group launches the server into a target group where an internet-facing load balancer directs traffic to the target group.
